 <h2>De'Anna-Shanae Beadle</h2>
 <p>I am a second year student of the UWI currently pursuing a double major in Software Engineering and Biotechnology. In my free time I enjoy cooking and listening to music. My favourite genre of music is RnB while my favourite artistes are Kehlani and Drake. In the future i hope to work in the field of technology or in biotechnology as a researcher. I picked INFO2180/ Web development as a course this semester because I was interested in expanding my knowledge and learning new skills.</p>
